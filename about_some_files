=== UNITS
Units that are identical for both projects (PapajScript files):
– Unit2.pas (the main engine of PS)
– UnitEntity.pas (PS's entities, settings and some constants)
– UnitFunctions.pas (PS's built-in functions)
– UnitStack.pas (PS's semi-stack)
– UnitEnvironment.pas (PS environment and interpreter main mechanisms)
– UnitVariables.pas (PS variables)
– MathUtils.pas (PS mathematical functions)
– DTUtils.pas (PS datetime management functions)
– ArrayUtils.pas (PS array functions)
– ConsoleUtils.pas (a better Crt substitute for Unix systems)

Units that exist in both projects, but they differ slightly in each of them.
– Unit5.pas (A connector between the console output or GUI and PS language)

Additional units of rpn_console
– UnitREPL.pas (REPL of PapajScript)

Additional units of rpn_gui
– Unit1.pas (the GUI application code)
– Unit3.pas (the language files)
– Unit4.pas (an additional unit to support Unit5.pas, i.e. the connector between GUI and PS language)


=== REQUIREMENTS TO COMPILE THE PROJECT AND BUILDING RPN CALCULATOR
– Have installed
    a) Lazarus IDE (version 1.6 or higher recommended – I use Lazarus 2.0.4 as of now) 
    b) or FreePascal Compiler (FPC) for Console app (3.0.4 recommended, Unix/Linux users only)
– There are three ways to build RPN Calculator
    a) if you have Lazarus IDE and you use the GUI app, 
       then compile it by clicking "Run" or "Compile"
    b) if you have Lazarus IDE and you are on a command shell or you don't use the GUI app, 
       then simply run compile.sh (in Unix/Linux systems) or compile.bat (in Windows systems) to compile the project
    c) if you don't have Lazarus IDE and you use a Unix/Linux-like system, 
       then you may compile the project using compileWithFPC.sh (for Console app only)
– You can make a Desktop shortcut to a RPN REPL by running installREPL.sh (Unix/Linux) or installREPL.bat (Windows)


=== REPORTED FLAWS
– Windows systems' shell usage does not work
– Non-linear recursion does not work
– Runtime parameters don't work
– Chi-squared generator fails for big sample data when df = 1
– Student's T generator may round values to 0.5, when df > 100 and |x| < 0.3
