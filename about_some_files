=== UNITS
Units that are identical for both projects (PapajScript files):
– Unit2.pas (the main engine of PS)
– UnitEntity.pas (PS'S entities, variables, settings and some constants)
– UnitFunctions.pas (PS's built-in functions)
– UnitStack.pas (PS's semi-stack)
– UnitEnvironment.pas (PS environment and interpreter main mechanisms)

Units that exist in both projects, but they differ slightly in each of them.
– Unit5.pas (A connector between the console output or GUI and PS language)

Additional units of rpn_gui
– Unit1.pas (the GUI application code)
– Unit3.pas (the language files)
– Unit4.pas (an additional unit to support Unit5.pas, i.e. the connector between GUI and PS language)


=== REQUIREMENTS TO COMPILE THE PROJECT
– Have installed Lazarus IDE (I use Lazarus 1.6, it would probably work on higher versions too)
– if you are using Windows systems, then compile it using Lazarus IDE by clicking "Run" or "Compile"
– if you are using Linux, then you can either do the same as Windows users or just run the ./compile.sh scripts

=== REPORTED FLAWS
– The variables' scopes don't work always properly.
– Windows systems' shell usage does not work as of now
