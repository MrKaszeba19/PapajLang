## About PapajScript
**PapajScript** (PS) is an interpreted language being used in RPN Calculator. It has been developed while working on RPN Calculator. The PS's code aims to be compact and easily appendable.  
Its structure is based mostly on Reverse Polish Notation (with a handful of exceptions), which uses a stack when computing values. Therefore all the operations are being done on the stack. The PS's semi-stack is an extended version of a classic stack, as we can get an indirect access to the entities not being on the top of the semi-stack and we can programme it like this semi-stack can simulate the behavior of a queue. The entities are put on the stack and may be used from the semi-stack, however we can also store them in the named variables.  
Everything comes around the semi-stack and the entities. The entities may be numbers, text strings, logical expressions, functions, arrays or exceptions.  
The future enhancements of the language include an introduction of objects and better file management.
