Version X.X.X (Leviathan)

Since 11/24/2017, proudly written in FreePascal. :smile:

**Note**: The Leviathan version is a development one. It may be sometimes pretty unstable. The stable releases are found in other Git branches. You can obtain the latest version of RPN Calculator (**v.0.5.1**, nickname Khaf) [here](https://github.com/RooiGevaar19/RPNCalculator/releases).

## How to use it

### Console application
- Execute a command **rpn do** with a quoted PS expression (e.g. `rpn do "2 3 + 4 *"`). More info about expressions in `rpn expression` and `rpn functions`.
- Remember that all values and operands must be delimited with at least 1 whitespace char (e.g. space bar).
- If you need help, you can type `rpn help`.
- If you want to run an PS script file, then execute `rpn FILENAME` or `rpn run FILENAME`. If you want to include some input parameters that would be laid on the stack when script begins, 
then provide them after the FILENAME delimited by space, e.g. `rpn run FILENAME param1 param2 param3`. 
All these params are treated as PS expressions. For example `rpn run script.ppsc 2 3 4` executes script.rpn with input parameters of `2 3 4` being laid on the stack.
- If you want to run a REPL of PapajScript, then execute `rpn repl`.

### GUI Application
- Open an app executable.
- In order to compute an PS expression, just type it in the upper text box and click the "Count it!"-button. The result appears in the result box below.
- There is also a simple script running engine – just paste your PS script or load it from file and click "Run script" to see its result.
- Remember that all values and operands must be delimited with at least 1 whitespace char (e.g. space bar).

## Requirements and installation
- Have installed
    * **Lazarus IDE** (version 1.6 or higher recommended – I use Lazarus 2.0.4 as of now) 
    * or **FreePascal Compiler (FPC)** (3.0.4 recommended) for Console app only – *alternative for Unix/Linux users only*
- There are three ways to build RPN Calculator
    * if you have Lazarus IDE and you use the GUI app,  
    then compile it by clicking "Run" or "Compile"
    * if you have Lazarus IDE and you are on a command shell or you don't use the GUI app,  
    then simply run `compile.sh` (in Unix/Linux systems) or `compile.bat` (in Windows systems) to compile the project
    * if you don't have Lazarus IDE and you use a Unix/Linux-like system,  
    then you may compile the project using `compileWithFPC.sh` (for Console app only)
- You can make a Desktop shortcut to a RPN REPL by running `installREPL.sh` (Unix/Linux) or `installREPL.bat` (Windows)

## PapajScript:

### About the language
**PapajScript** (PS) is an interpreted language being used in RPN Calculator. It has been developed while working on RPN Calculator. The PS's code aims to be compact and easily appendable.  
Its structure is based mostly on Reverse Polish Notation (with a handful of exceptions), which uses a stack when computing values. Therefore all the operations are being done on the stack. The PS's semi-stack is an extended version of a classic stack, as we can get an indirect access to the entities not being on the top of the semi-stack and we can programme it like this semi-stack can simulate the behavior of a queue. The entities are put on the stack and may be used from the semi-stack, however we can also store them in the named variables.  
Everything comes around the semi-stack and the entities. The entities may be numbers, text strings, logical expressions, functions, arrays or exceptions.  
The future enhancements of the language include an introduction of objects and better file management.

Find more about the language in this [wiki](https://github.com/RooiGevaar19/RPNCalculator/wiki).

## REPL Commands
- `\` at the very end of the input line allows for multi-line commands 
- `\autoreset:BOOL` - allow REPL to reset the stack every move (BOOL=true/false, false by default)
- `\autoreset` - same as `\autoreset:true`
- `\reset` - reset the REPL.
- `\export:FILE` - export your history to a file (FILE is a relative or absolute path)
- `\history` - display the previously typed commands
- `\hclear` - clear all history
- `\hclear:N` - repeat the N-th command of history (N >= 1)
- `\import:FILE` - run a file (FILE is a relative or absolute path)
- `\!!` - repeat last command
- `\!N` - execute an N-th command of `\history` (N >= 1)
- `\help` - display the help.
- `\q` or `\quit` - exit the REPL.
