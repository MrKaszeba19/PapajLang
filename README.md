## About
**Reverse Polish Notation** (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. It allows to evaluate the mathematical expressions without using parentheses.

## Examples of RPN expressions

 Ordinary expression             | RPN Expression
---------------------------------+---------------------------
 5                               | 5
 2 + 3                           | 2 3 +
 (2.5 * 2) + 5                   | 2.5 2 * 5 +
 -4 * (2 / 3)                    | -4 2 3 / *
 (2 + 5) * (11 - 7)              | 2 5 + 11 7 - *
 ((8 - 2) / 3 + (1 + 4) * 2) / 6 | 8 2 - 3 / 1 4 + 2 * + 6 /
